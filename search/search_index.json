Dont know how to swim. You got arrested and sentenced to the lower depths penal colony, working as a junker. As a junker, you go into a sunken warship to collect scrap, but for this mission you will have an special assignment: instead of collecting scrap, like usual, you must deactivate or eject the nuclear core of the warship, to prevent it from exploding and allowing future crews to come and collect scrap. You're the first person entering it after it sunk to the bottom. You must do a perfect job, in order to build trust on your supervisor, allowing you to eventually abuse that trust. But for now, everything must be by the book. The docking operation is a very delicate one, since the ship is on the verge of breaking apart and further sinking into the abyss. The estimation is that once the approach starts, everything will fall apart after a safe margin of 50 minutes (50 * 60 * 2 = 6000 turns, with a second flipping every two seconds). Besides valuable material, it is useful for you to observe the standard issue on those warships, to plan your eventual escape. For now, all the player will do is make remarks once he lay eyes on the interesting findings. The game: A problem will happen during the mission, once you're already inside the ship: as a hacker, to make your job easier, you manage to reenable the central computer (allowing you to operate doors, instead of having to cut thru it, which would take too long). However, a failsafe system will seal the bridge, as well as the sensitive corridors. to your ship. If the player tries to leave without entering those corridors, the supervisor will say you must return or not allowed back into the base, running out of oxygen in the process. In order to disable the seal protocol, you will have to escalate privileges, physically. One of the many dead bodies (dressed in a slightly more elaborate uniform) will have a keycard in its pocket. Using this keycard, you begin unravelling the thread that wil eventualy lead to the root keycard. Meanwhile, you must also prevent the overloading reactor from melting down, which would cause a big explosion and probably kill evebody in the neighbouring colonies - you can do this by ejecting the rods into the abyss; doing so, requires access to the machine room, using the root keycard. The root keycard stays in the situation room - a last ditch effort to prevent amotinated crew from taking over the ship. To enter it, you must first get the high-ranking card on the radar array. During all this time, you get very intermitent contact with your supervisor and he will discuss the ideas without, learning of your skills.","title":"Episode0"}]}
