<p>First act: power and glory
You're a convicted hacker serving a sentence in a penal underwater city, tasked with helping with tearing apart old derelict vessels from the old wars. While doing this very menial work, your old talents are picked up by the prison director, who's a survivor from the war and still has a lot of hybrid implants, from his captive days. Using your skills, you can help him overcome the pain and disabilities and earn some prestige to eventually prepare a daring escape.</p>
<p>Second act: the sword of damocles
During a hybrid raid, you take the chance and, along with some fellow captives, steal one of their subs, to become a rogue vessel roaming the seas.</p>
<p>While on a raid, you make contact with another rogue vessel and the two strike a truce, but after seeing evidence of this same rogue vessel selling humans to become slave-hybrids, you go in revenge.</p>
<p>Third act: warrior king
Eventually, you begin to learn of a new breed of hybrids that subjected themselves to nanotechnology and are capable of breathing underwater. They're attacking a city that once sheltered you (in response to you defending them against the first rogue vessel) and you go in their defense. Winning against this new breed of hybrids earn their respect to the point that you are appointed as their sherriff.</p>
<p>First act details:
- gain trust of the warden by running errands. Eventually, you must let him "discover" that you're a hacker.
- gain trust of the director by treating his implants
- gain trust of other inmates by proposing an escape plan. Also sending a bully to solitaire also helps.
- notice what warships could be restored and where to find weapons, move parts from one ship to another
- collect equipment required for hacking the cell door: magnetic seal parts from prison ship, divers knife, battery, crytal oscilator, memory core and CPU</p>
<p>Game starts:
You wake up from the transportation-hibernation along with a group of former military inmates, some of them with hybrid implants.
You gain their goodwill by helping them deal with it (and, in turn, making your name, which will help with the director) while also promissing to use those skills to help everybody escape.
You will need to collect components to reenable the enhancements.</p>
<p>Along the way, you wil also face sea creatures from the depths and pirate raids.</p>
<p>Guns you can use during this time:
- metal pipe
- diver's knife
- blowtorch
- flare gun</p>
