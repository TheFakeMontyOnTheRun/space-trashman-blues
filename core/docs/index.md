Space Trashman Blues
====================

You're a space trash man. Your mission is to enter an old space station, collect as much valuable material as possible, find the correct spot to plant a bomb, activate it and get out. You must ensure that the bomb is correctly placed, to ensure the station get's destroyed.


I'm a space junker. There is no day I curse more this fate. What else can I say? They can't stand me anymore. They keep saying that if you are not happy, you go looking for something else. Now it seems almost like a revenge. Lucas had to warn me so late about the misscalculation?! I only got some 15 minutes or so to do this one. It is my stuff in the line and I might lose my license. At least he had the decency to warn me about some possible gas leakage and the lack of artificial gravity (not invented by then, it seems). Hope this blowtorch is enough to cut this old metal. And that I'm all alone in here...
	
I must admit: I love going through other people's stuff.I see whole lives unfolding in front of me. Almost like a diorama or a shrine. And I tend to keep the best stuff to myself, despite what it might worth. And then, blowing up the station - almost like a special burial. I'm doing this people a favor. I tend to uncover the mysteries they never could in life, simply by going through other people's stuff. It's a requiem.
