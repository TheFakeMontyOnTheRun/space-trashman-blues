gl-frontend
===========

The OpenGL frontend uses the most basic resources from that library, in order 
to stay compatible with the most possible systems that support at least some
OpenGL version.

It is based on a heavily modified version of the mx-frontend, and thoroughly
tested on an old PowerPC Mac - but eventually, some decisions on how it handles
resources came to cather to more "byzantine" systems, such as the Nintendo 64
and Nintendo DS (both of which are supported).

Unoficially, this port is known as the 64-bit port, despite not requiring or
making any special use of 64-bit identifiers. In a sense, it is the next
evolutionary step after software rendering and 2.5D projections.
Think of Quake after Doom.
