ee-frontend
===========

The EE frontend began as an exclusive port from the OpenGL version to the
Sony Playstation 2, to run on it's Emotion Engine (hence the EE). As such,
it still bears some OpenGL trappings in its organization (and even some 
naming). However, given how _different_ the Graphics Synthetizer on that
machine, a lot of compromises and changes had to be made.

This is a highly unstable port, lagging behind even the Nintendo DS (GL) and
Game Boy Advanced (MX) ports that came after it.

The desire is to eventually add support for the Nintendo Gamecube and/or Wii,
given that this is the "128-bit" port.

It might be useful to eventually add a OpenGL ES version here as well, to
help on debuggability, as the the flexilbility of that library would afford
us more fidelity.
